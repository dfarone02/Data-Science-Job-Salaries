Using the interim data created in the prior section:

For the purposes of the logistic regression model:

Data Analyst: <br>
 - Created "X" dataset from all variables except "Data Analyst"
 - Created "y" dataset from "Data Analyst"
 - Used sklearn train-test-split for 80% of the data as training and 20% remaining of random sample as testing data
